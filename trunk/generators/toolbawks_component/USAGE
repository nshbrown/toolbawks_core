Description:
  The Toolbawks Component generator assists in creating stub directories
  which are common to each of the components within the Toolbawks framework.

Example:
  ./script/generate toolbawks_component [<component_name>]

  This will generate:

    RAILS_ROOT
      |- vendor
          |-plugins
              |-toolbawks_component_name

  which contains all the code for a Toolbawks Component.
